Hello there, I am currently learning React and this is my first react website. I made it using bootstrap, it can used to Manipulate your text like if you want to capitalize your characters or want to convert them into lower case, whether you want to remove extra spaces between them or count all of your words, this is for you.
I know this is pretty simple and not so very good looking but it is first so, yeah!
My Name is "Vivek" btw.
